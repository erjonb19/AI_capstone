> **Predict • Prepare • Place • Post-Hire Outcomes**

Sorvex 360 is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that generates synthetic utility workforce candidate profiles and trains predictive models to identify retention risk, safety risk, and promotion likelihood before a candidate is hired.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The utility industry faces a critical workforce challenge — high turnover, aging workforce, and difficulty predicting which candidates will succeed in skilled trades roles. Sorvex 360 addresses this by:

1. **Generating** a statistically grounded synthetic dataset of 5,000 utility workforce candidate profiles across 6 SOC codes
2. **Training** gradient boosting models to predict 3 key post-hire outcomes
3. **Serving** predictions through a REST API that returns Low/Medium/High risk tiers per candidate
4. **Storing** all data in BigQuery and registering models in Vertex AI for production use

## 📊 Four-Phase Data Schema

| Phase | Name | Records | Key Fields |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Predict** | 5,000 | Demographics, Assessment Scores, PI Score |
| 2 | **Prepare** | 5,000 | Training Hours, Attendance, Certifications |
| 3 | **Place** | 5,000 | Employer, Employment Type, Compliance |
| 4 | **Post-Hire** | 5,000 | Tenure, Safety Incidents, Promotions |

All phases joined on `CandidateID` → `PlacementID`.

## 🤖 Models

Three binary classifiers trained using Gradient Boosting with class-weight balancing:

| Model | Target | AUC-ROC | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Retention | `Tenure_1Year` | 0.70 | Will candidate stay 12+ months? |
| Safety | `OSHA_Recordable_Incident` | 0.53 | OSHA incident likelihood |
| Promotion | `PromotionWithin24Months` | 0.55 | Promotion within 24 months |

**Key features:** `Sorvex360PI_Score`, `Completed`, `AttendanceRate`, `SafetyCommitmentScore`, `TotalTrainingHours`, `ReadinessDelta`
